# LinuxGeneralInstallers
Just some simple bash scripts that will install softwares that I love and use :)


## Instructions
To use, just download the .zip package, unzip it and run the ProgramNameInstaller.sh (where ProgramName is the name of the program, like WaterfoxCurrentInstaller).

Then, the files will be moved to the correct location in your system. By default, the apps are moved to .apps in your home folder and games are installed in .games folder in home too. Icons go to to your user home .local/share/icons and finally the .desktop app go to .local/share/applications (in your home user too)

When you execute the installer.sh, all others files should left the folder. if some file is still there, you probably need to create some folder manually (I will update the script later so it will not happen anymore). After the installation, your program should appear in your DE menu (gnome, xfce, lxqt, kde and so on).


## Troubleshooting 

### I don't trust your scripts because they come with a folder of the unziped binary
Well, you don't need to. You can download your own binary for the program and use it with the scripts. Every script is open source and you can see what it is doing.
